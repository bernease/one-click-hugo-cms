    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field within computer science that
    focuses on allowing 

    computers to interpret, understand, and manipulate human language. 


    The ability these APIs generate — to understand and respond to human
    generated text and 

    emotion — sits at the heart of successful human-machine interaction. It also
    looks set to 

    become an increasingly pervasive feature of our lives. However, the
    computerized interpretation

    of human language and emotion is fraught with difficulties. In particular,
    the language we use 

    reveals a great deal about who we are — our class, gender, race, education
    level, and national 

    background — making us vulnerable to new forms of bias or discrimination.


    Investigating these questions, one major academic study found evidence of
    gender and racial bias 

    in 200 publically available sentiment-analysis APIs (Kiritchenko, 2018).
    Another study focused on 

    tweets from different subgroups and found that ‘current systems sometimes
    analyze the language 

    of females and minorities more poorly than they do of whites and males’. In
    particular, they found a 

    ‘racial disparity in accuracy difference’ for African Americans (Blodgett
    and O’Connor, 2017). 


    These issues have the potential to cause real harm. Sentiment analysis tools
    are already used at 

    scale for a wide variety of purposes, including the development of
    recommendation systems that 

    parse written reviews, the creation of more human-like customer service
    chatbots, and the triage 

    of text messages received by crisis response lines, in order to identify the
    most vulnerable people. 


    To cast further light on the question of bias in NLP sentiment analysis, our
    team surveyed and 

    compared the output of four major commercial APIs: those provided by IBM
    Watson, Amazon, 

    Microsoft and Google.

      We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
      independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a variety
      of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and local
      communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
